# InfoPanel.FPS Plugin

A plugin for the InfoPanel app that leverages `PresentMonFps` to monitor and display real-time performance metrics for fullscreen applications.

**NOTE!** This version is not compatible with games that use kernel level anitcheat, like Battlefield 6, Valorant etc. 
To capture FPS and metrics for games like that, you can use InfoPanel.RTSS. https://github.com/F3NN3X/InfoPanel.RTSS

## Overview

InfoPanel.FPS provides detailed performance statistics for running fullscreen applications, enabling users to monitor gaming performance in real-time through InfoPanel's interface. The plugin tracks FPS, frame times, and low percentile data, updating every second with efficient event-driven detection.
